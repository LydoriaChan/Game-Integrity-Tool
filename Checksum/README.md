📦 Game Manifests (Checksums)

This folder contains the "Gold Master" hash files for various games. These are used to verify if your local game files are corrupted, missing, or modified.
🔍 Why use these?

If you have modded your game and it starts crashing, or you suspect a bad download, these manifests allow the Game Integrity Tool to audit your folder.
🚦 How to use:

    Download the .md5 file that matches your game version (e.g., FalloutNV_GOG.md5).

    Open the Game Integrity Tool.

    Select your Game Folder.

    Click "Verify Using Local Hash" and select the .md5 file you just downloaded.

    Check the log for Corrupt, Missing, or Extra files.
